    "Our first workshop was a milestone event that helped us build confidence, connect with students, and lay the groundwork for future initiatives.",
  body: `
We successfully hosted our very first workshop, an event that, while modest in size, left a significant and lasting impact on everyone involved. This milestone was an important step for our club, giving us the chance to put our planning into action and see how our ideas translate into real student engagement. As leaders, we gained invaluable experience in interacting with the audience, managing public speaking responsibilities, and coordinating the event from start to finish. It also allowed us to showcase the vision and goals of our club while building stronger connections with participants.

Beyond delivering the workshop content, we focused on creating an encouraging and motivating environment for all students who attended. CQUniversity’s diverse and widely dispersed student community presents incredible opportunities to reach and support more learners across multiple campuses. Through this experience, we recognized our potential to positively influence student retention, enhance the university life experience, and create a stronger sense of community and belonging. This workshop not only marked the beginning of our club’s journey but also set the stage for more impactful events and initiatives in the future.

    "We gathered to share our diverse perspectives for the foundation of the club — sparking student activism and peer-to-peer culture at CQUniversity.",
  body: `
Our club began with an open exchange of diverse ideas and perspectives from students across multiple campuses. In these early discussions we explored what it means to build an inclusive, student-led space that encourages creativity, collaboration, and leadership. This initiation is about more than forming a club — it’s about creating a movement that empowers students to speak up, take ownership of their university experience, and shape the culture of CQUniversity.

By promoting student activism in the best way possible, we aim to nurture a strong peer-to-peer culture and establish the club as a proud symbol of innovation, diversity, and engagement. Through our combined visions and efforts, we hope to make CQUniversity not only a place of academic achievement but also a vibrant community where students feel supported, connected, and inspired to make a difference.

    "O-Week buzz: 100+ Expressions of Interest, strong engagement, and a clear path to build one connected CQUniversity community.",
  body: `
Each semester welcomes a high volume of new students to CQUniversity, and this year’s Orientation Week was no exception. In the context of the international student cap, our focus has been on making students feel genuinely supported from day one and ensuring funds are used to strengthen belonging and retention. Our stall team spent the week engaging with students, answering questions, and sharing how the club creates real opportunities for learning, collaboration, and leadership.

The response was incredibly positive. Many students expressed excitement about joining and contributing to our initiatives, reinforcing the importance of maintaining momentum beyond O-Week. To sustain this energy, we aim to increase our presence across all campuses so every student feels part of one connected community. By the end of the stalls, we’d collected **100+ Expressions of Interest**, a strong indicator that students are keen to participate and that our community-first approach is working.

CQUniversity’s continued growth and expansion give us a powerful opportunity to represent the university more extensively through its clubs and societies. By showcasing student leadership, innovation, and collaboration, we highlight the strength of our diverse community. As someone once said, “Sky is the limit,” and this rings especially true for our club’s vision. We are committed to building on this momentum by creating initiatives that foster leadership skills, develop future changemakers, and amplify the voice of students across all campuses.

This expansion also opens the door to exciting partnerships beyond the university. Our mission is not only to grow bigger but to reach out to other organisations, industries, and community groups that align with our goals. By collaborating strategically and seeking new funding opportunities, we can scale our projects to an even greater level of impact. This approach will enable us to deliver innovative programs, support more students, and establish CQUniversity as a proud leader in student-led initiatives, empowering our members to shape a future without limits.

As a club originally based solely in Sydney, we have been fortunate to receive funding for cutting-edge tech equipment such as Raspberry Pi kits and various sensors. This support has allowed us to explore and experiment with emerging technologies, giving our members hands-on experience in areas that go beyond the classroom. By utilising these resources strategically, we’ve not only improved our time management and project planning but also created a pathway to showcase our work more effectively across different channels, reaching a wider audience and inspiring other students to get involved.

Through this funding, our members have developed several exciting projects that demonstrate both creativity and technical skill. These initiatives highlight the club’s capacity to innovate, collaborate, and deliver tangible results in a short period of time:

- IoT & Extended Home Sensors via Raspberry Pi – experimenting with connected devices and home automation.  
- Our Club’s Website Development – building a modern online presence to communicate and engage with students.  
- Game Development – designing and testing a prototype for a fun, interactive Raspberry Pi–based game.  
- Face Recognition Test – exploring computer vision and security applications using open-source libraries.

These projects have not only strengthened our technical portfolio but also enhanced our project management, teamwork, and communication skills — critical capabilities for both academic success and future careers.
